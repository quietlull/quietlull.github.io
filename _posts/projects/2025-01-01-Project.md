## FISH FIGHTING RING

A Fish Based Game is an arena autobattler where you catch and breed the ultimate fish to defeat your rivals.

We made this game for Ludum Dare 56 as a team of two and it was my first time as an artist in unreal engine. We ended up only having 2 days to work on the game due to having work during its creation but I think we ended up making a pretty unique game. I ended up creating the “blendfishes” and rig, as well as the “levels” for the game. I really wanted to insert a little bit of that child-like wonder into it inspired a little by pokemon. 

### So What's Cool About A Fish Based Game?

A Fish Based Game had some pretty cool tech art features that we were able to do involving the fish and the variety of possible fish you could end up making. The result is a game where there is essentially an infinite number of possible fish you could create. Here are the major features that I worked on for the game and a little more on them. 

1. Procedural Swimming Animations

2. Use Of Gradient Mapping For Fish Colors 

3. Different Blendshapes For The Fish Model

4. Designing The Rivals And Funny Fish Enemies

For this game jam I mainly worked on just art and design with all the programming being done by my partner for the project Quinton.

I wanted to include a figma board for our original ideas on how the fishes would work as well as different behaviors but it seems that its lost to time. I wanted the fish to be able to have a few specific behaviors that would trigger upon some specific senarios. you can see they are when idle, take damage, and tap glass. you can see some of the goofy sticky notes i made as tutorials in the game and they serve as a simple way for players to quickly get whats going on.

Originally when testing the games each trait of the fish had the same probability of appearing which was later changed. We also later realized that idle was actually super lame and we ended up making that appear the least before removing it completely and replacing it with one of my favorite features
