                <h3>Hey There, I'm Rod</h3>
                <p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm not sure who's going to be reading this but I hope you will enjoy the random things that are on here as well as just some of my thoughts on games among other things.</p>
                
                <p>I started game dev in 2023 when I attended Vancouver Film School but have loved games long before then. Since my time there, I've been making little projects here and there studying up
                on art techniques and game design philosophy. </p>
                
                <p>The blog here is just a small way to keep track of thoughts, ideas, and projects as well as putting myself out there. I believe that 
                the best way to improve is to share your work as well as actively trying new things. Any feedback is always welcome and I'm always looking to learn more and grow!</p>

            <h3>More About Me</h3>
            <p>Before I was a game dev I wanted to become a professional starcraft 2 player. I've always had a love for competitive games and have held top ranking slots in a ton of different games from hearthstone,
            to puyo puyo tetris, I'm an avid gamer who loves the thrill of competing at a high level.  
            </p>
            <p>When I'm not working, studying, or gaming, you can catch me writing in my journal, reading books, or watching anime and tv shows. I'm always excited for new ideas and trying new things!
            Feel free to explore my site to learn more about my work, read my blog posts, or get in touch for questions, feedback, or anything else!
